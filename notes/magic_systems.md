- Charms and tokens
- Items
- Symbols
- Incantation
- Alchemy

## Seraphiel's Magic System
- study from textbooks, self-teaching books, curriculums, and field research
- refined from observation and experimentation
- uses internal meditative space for refinement

Quote:

	"I realized no singular medium was right. In fact, none of them were right and it didn't matter. The nature of magic consists of presence and identification. As long as you could identify what you were doing and what you wanted from it, the means were little more than mental tools. One's capacity to comprehend and refine their perception of the presence they're ultimately aiming for was what determined the effectiveness of one's magic. In other words, someone who wants fire can conjure it in any way that enables them to perceive its presence, yet how much control they'd have, what they'd be capable of, and how much they could conjure would depend on the clarity and focus of their perception. So I created my own language. It's been a while since I've added any new terms to it, but having my own language enables me to refine, test and examine my own perception. I can do whatever I want."

	"It's a language. I found it in some books a long time ago. I can't remember them anymore."

### Ideology
Entity: a physical object that receives, circulates and expels from an essence
- living
  - sensory: smell, touch, taste, orientation, distance/measure, sight, sound
  - self: soul, memory, affect (traces of self in and from others)
- deceased
  - part that leaves (soul)
  - part that dissolves
  - part that disperses (traces)

Classification: imperceptible concepts formed from language to characterize, describe, or process entities
- includes notions of types, measures, mathematical explanations, etc.

Commonality: essence shared between given entities
Specificity: essence exclusive to an entity
Generality: essence of an entity separate from the entity
Difference: essence varying between a number of entities
Focal: means of perceiving and distinguishing entities
- shared: based on an entity
- derived: based on one's own entity
Center: one's own entity

Entirety: everything of essence
Presence: locations and concentrations of essences

**Process of accessing satellite perception**
1. Identify satellite
2. Access satellite entity
3. Stimulate focals with classifications
4. Remap to core
5. Filter mappings
6. Create entity from remaining mappings

Note:
1. Mappings are dynamic and change even amidst access
2. Time is a concept and so doesn't exist as a focal
